The Senate put in Bill C-14 that medical assistance in dying be available to those whose underlying medical condition is a mental health condition only. Everyone here, regardless of partisanship, is struggling to make sure Canadians do not seek access to medical assistance in dying if there is another option that allows them to continue to live.

    "text":"Madam Speaker, I think it is my assistant calling me, telling me it is time to speak. She is very efficient.\nAs I was saying, the bill proposes to extend the temporary mental illness exclusion, so that the provision of medical assistance in dying, or MAID, on the basis of mental illness alone would remain prohibited until March 17, 2027. In my remarks today, I will be addressing some of the concerns that have been expressed about allowing MAID for mental illness and the importance of ensuring that our health care system is ready before legalizing this practice.\nAs members know, Bill C-7 temporarily excluded MAID for mental illness until March 2023. Parliament extended the exclusion for an additional year after organizations such as the Association of Chairs of Psychiatry in Canada and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health expressed a need for additional time. The Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying, or AMAD, also supported the extension.\nAt the outset of my remarks, I want to emphasize that the government recognizes that mental suffering may be as severe as physical suffering. We know that not all individuals with a mental illness lack decision-making capacity. The extension of the temporary exclusion of eligibility for MAID is not based on these stigmatizing stereotypes.\nI also want to announce my profound sympathy for anyone in Canada who is intolerably suffering because of a health disorder. My thoughts are with them.\n While the federal government believes that MAID eligibility should be expanded to those whose sole condition is a mental illness, this process cannot be rushed. Over the past year, important progress has been made to prepare for the expansion, but provinces and territories are at varying stages of readiness. The federal government has listened to its partners and introduced this bill as a direct response to their concerns.\nA cautious, deliberate and rigorous framework is essential to ensure the safe provision of MAID where a mental illness grounds a request for MAID. Debate about the parameters of the MAID regime has been taking place since before the Supreme Court of Canada's 2015 decision in Carter, in which it held that the absolute prohibition on physician-assisted dying was unconstitutional. This is a sign of a healthy democracy.\nMost recently, the Special Joint Committee on MAID witnessed the diversity of views and expertise first-hand. Some witnesses who testified, such as Dr. Trudo Lemmens, chair in health law and policy at the University of Toronto, expressed concerns about permitting MAID where the sole underlying condition is a mental illness. Others, including the members of the Canadian Association of MAID Assessors and Providers, thought the country was ready for the current March 17, 2024 deadline.\nStill others supported expanding MAID for mental illness, or accepted that it would become legal but recommended a delay. This recommendation came from Dr. Jitender Sareen of the University of Manitoba on behalf of eight chairs of psychiatry departments in Canada. The chairs of psychiatry outlined several reasons, including concerns about a need for further safeguards and accepted definitions of irremediability in mental disorders, before moving forward.\nI would like to acknowledge the important contributions that have been made on this topic. While not everyone agrees, it is clear that we all care deeply about the well-being of those seeking MAID and the protection of the vulnerable.\nLet me now get into some of the specific concerns that have been raised. Members will recall that certain eligibility criteria need to be met to qualify for MAID. This includes having a grievous and irremediable medical condition, which requires that a person be in an advanced state of irreversible decline.\nSome doctors, such as Dr. Sonu Gaind, chief of psychiatry at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, have said it is impossible to predict which patients with a mental illness will get better; in other words, we cannot determine whether their illness is irremediable. However, other experts, including members of the expert panel on MAID and mental illness, suggest that the evolution of the illness and the response to past interventions can be used to assess irremediability, as is done with some physical conditions such as chronic pain.\nConcerns have also been raised, by Dr. Sareen and others, that it is too difficult to distinguish between suicidality and a rational request for MAID when the request is based on a mental illness alone, because suicidality may be a symptom of the mental illness itself. Dr. Stefanie Green acknowledged that this can be complicated, but testified before the MAID committee that clinicians have a duty to assess every patient for suicidality. It is something that doctors do regularly in clinical practice. In addition, MAID assessments may involve suicide prevention efforts where warranted.\nAnother concern expressed by Dr. Tarek Rajji, the chair of the medical advisory committee at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, is that there was no consensus within the medical community about whether MAID should be available for persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental illness. However, others, including Dr. Green, note that the lack of consensus in the medical community is not unique to MAID.\nA last concern that I want to address is that individuals are requesting MAID due to a structural and systemic vulnerability, such as lack of income and social supports. I want to be clear that the law requires that the suffering be due to illness, disease or disability, not poverty or unmet needs.\nOur government is confident that the existing safeguards will ensure that only those who meet the eligibility criteria receive MAID. We are also determined to invest in social programs that can alleviate non-medical suffering and bolster social supports. Our MAID framework contains two sets of safeguards, one for requests where natural death is reasonably foreseeable and the other, more robust set for requests where natural death is not reasonably foreseeable.\nThe second set of safeguards would apply to cases where a mental illness is the basis of a MAID request. These include a requirement for a doctor or nurse practitioner with expertise in the condition to be involved in the assessment, a longer assessment period of 90 days, a requirement that the patient has been informed of the means available to relieve their suffering and has been offered consultations with relevant professionals, and a requirement that both assessors and patient agree that the patient has given serious consideration to the reasonable and available means of relieving their suffering.\nIn addition to these stringent safeguards, there is other guidance for doctors, nurse practitioners and regulators, including a model practice standard. Implementation of robust regulatory guidance and additional resources is ongoing, as is uptake of the nationally accredited bilingual MAID curriculum.\nWe are confident that, with more time, we can achieve readiness to ensure the safe provision of MAID in circumstances in which a mental illness grounds the request for MAID. We have made important strides, but work remains to be done to prepare health care systems and for more doctors and nurse practitioners to benefit from the available training and supports.\nOur government thinks that three years is enough time to complete this work, so that our health care system is prepared when MAID for mental illness is permitted. In addition, we are proposing to add a requirement for a parliamentary review by a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament, to start within two years of this bill's receiving royal assent.\nThe committee will have six months to submit a report, including a statement of any recommended Criminal Code changes. This review will inform government action and ensure that they move forward only once the Canadian health care systems are ready.\nWith the March 17, 2024 deadline fast approaching, I urge everyone to work together to see that this bill is adopted before that date.",

My colleague sat on the committee that produced the report tabled in February 2023, which recommended allowing advance requests. \nWhy has his government not introduced a section on advance requests after a year of waiting?
